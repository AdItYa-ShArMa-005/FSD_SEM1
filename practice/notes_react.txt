Steps to set-up environment:
1. open vs code
2. open folder where application is going to be stored
3. open terminal
4. run npx create-react-app <appname>(npm create vite@latest)
5. wait for set-up.
6. change terminal directory to your application(cd appname).

scaffolding:  all required dependencies are downloaded and brought up at a particular place.

react also starts with index.html first.

react uses a virtual DOM that stores changes and show us result on basis of that.
Later when all changes are done then main DOM is updated.

there are 2 types of components in react:
1- functional component
2- class component(depricated)

anything that we want to show on browser should be written inside 
return statement of app.js.

updated app.js
--------------------------------------------------------------
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    // cannot return two things
    // <h1>Hello us...</h1>
    // <h2> welcome to react class</h2>
    <div> 
      <h1>Hello us...</h1>
     <h2> welcome to react class</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 onClick={handleClick} : when button is clicked alert is generated
  onClick={handleClick()} : alert generate as soon as we open or refresh our web page.

  to avoid page relaoding use preventDefault();

  State is used to automatically render our components whereas till now we are doing it manuallly.

  Hooks are addition functionalities that allow us to use them in  functional component.

  setCount is just like setter that changes value of variable
  useState is use to initialize variable.

  useState is a hook that helps in initializing and rendring.
  useEffect is a hook helps in controling rendring, mounting and unmounting of DOM.
