react also starts with index.html first.

react uses a virtual DOM that stores changes and show us result on basis of that.
Later when all changes are done then main DOM is updated.

there are 2 types of components in react:
1- functional component
2- class component(depricated)

anything that we want to show on browser should be written inside 
return statement of app.js.
