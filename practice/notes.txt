difference b/w let, var, const
- scope
- mutability
-hoisting ( using before declaration )

odd loops: no.of repetitions not known priorily.

const type variable can be mutable but cannot be reassigned.

fuction expression--
const factorial = function(n)
{
    if(n == 1 || n == 0)
        return 1;
    else return n * factorial(n-1);
}

never print as console.log(factorial) as factorial is a variable storing a function. Use
console.log(factorial(5)), i.e., call as function.
