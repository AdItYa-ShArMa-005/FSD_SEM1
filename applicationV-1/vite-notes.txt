prop - component with arguments and parameters so that values can be interchanged between two components

in parameters, we can replace keyword props with anything.

<Header title="" />, <Footer greet="" person="" />: here title, greet, person are not keywords.
they can be changed. props act like object with them as attributes but they are not objects.

when we have to pass array to props we write it in {} i.e., const y=[2025,2026,2027]  <footer year={y}/>
in function we can print whole array or by index

This above statement is not true for objects. we need to specify which key-value to print.
